# Planned Priorities (In order of importance)

1. "Family Tree" Page - Family tree design of important guild member bios (class/race/level, focus, about me, rp info)
2. "Chronology" Page - Record keeping of events and important guild happenings. Possibly links to blog-style RP writing posts, screenshot/article style posts, and FAQ about important historic events.
3. "Resources" Page - Classic WoW, RP, WoW History, Guild Info, and any other resources viable possibly in a searchable index or table of some sort.
